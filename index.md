## About me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki working on sample-effiencient Bayesian inference with [Luigi Acerbi](https://lacerbi.github.io).

Prior to that, I was a postdoc at the University of Oxford and a Junior Research Fellow at Linacre College. There I worked with [Michael Osborne](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/)'s Bayesian Exploration Lab. I obtained my PhD degree under [Søren Hauberg](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~sohau/)'s supervision at the Technical University of Denmark. My thesis is available [here](https://jorgensenmart.github.io/PhDThesis.pdf).

For all publications please visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ncr-rA0AAAAJ&hl=da) and for short news you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JorgensenMart).
